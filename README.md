## Hello 👋 

I am Fahad Rasheed, Final Year Computer Engineering Student from NED University of Engineering and Technology. I am currently working as a Full-Stack Developer at Virtuosoft.

As a Computer Engineering Student, I have a unique edge, not only knowing the abstracted software but also  the underlying hardware of computers.

Software side, I specialise in:
- MERN
- TailwindCSS
- JavaScript 
- Python

And for hardware, I bring the knowledge of:
- Verilog 
- RISC-V Architecture 
- MIPS
- Vivado
- FPGA

I am capable of working in both domains and passionate about them. You can reach out to me for any queries or work right here on LinkedIn or on my email.

Cheers!
